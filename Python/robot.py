	About:
	==================	
	This is a simple script that can be used to place multiple wagers from input file in to Veikkaus gaming system. 
	Purpose of this script is to demonstrate how the JSON API provided by Veikkaus website works. Following functionality
	is included:
	
	- login
	- moniveto (multiscore) wagers
	
	
	Notes:
	==================	
	This script requires 'requests' package from http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ for session management, ensuring that the 
	site cookies are always properly included in the requests. 
	
	Using a http-client framework that supports authenticated sessions (i.e. cookies) out of the box is highly recommended.
	Veikkaus' website may change the cookies (names and content) unnoticed, and the clients (browsers or custom scripts), shall always use the
	cookies accordingly. It is not only the authentication, but also other requests may set and/or update the cookies. 
	Misbehavior may force us to close your gaming account.
	
	Requests that do not require authentication can be made "without session". However, making the requests as authenticated provides
	us valuable information on how you use the provided services, and thus further helps us to develop it to suite your needs better. 


	Usage:
	==================	
	How to display usage: 
	robot.py -h
	
	How to request winshares for set of Vakio (SPORT) boards:
	robot.py -a WINSHARE -g SPORT -d 12345 -f sport_input.txt
	
	How to list open draws for moniveto (MULTISORE):
	robot.py -a LIST_DRAWS -g MULTISCORE
	
	How to place moniveto (MULTISCORE) wagers for draw number 12345:
	robot.py -a PLAY -g MULTISCORE -d 12345 -u myaccount -p p4ssw0rd -f multiscore_input.txt -s 20

	How to get account balance
	robot.py -a BALANCE -u myaccount -p p4ssw0rd

	It is possible to run multiple instances of this robot. But it is recommended to run maximum of 5 robots at a same time for a single account.
	This is because debiting the single account becomes the bottleneck for robot-wagering, and multiple instances do no longer provide the benefit in speed.
